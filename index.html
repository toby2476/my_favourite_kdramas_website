        <h3 id="title-extraordinary-attorney-woo">5. Extraordinary Attorney Woo</h3>
        
        <img src="./images/extraordinary-attorney-woo.jpg"/>
        
        <p><em>Extraordinary Attorney Woo</em> is a heartwarming story about an autistic woman who starts
        her first job as an attorney. The story explores her struggles with adapting to and being accepted at her
        new workplace, as well as her unique strengths and talents as a lawyer.</p> 

        <p>The story delves deep into a lot of different cases
        that the main character encounters as an attorney, and how these impact the lives of everyone involved. Many of these
        cases are very interesting and thought provoking.</p>

        <p>Unlike many of the other dramas on this list, this is a lighthearted and feel good show. I really
            appreciate the way this show demonstrates that people with autism can live happy, productive and fulfilling lives.

    <div class="signal">
        <h3 id="title-signal">4. Signal</h3>

        <img src="./images/signal.jpg"/>

        <p><em>Signal</em> is a story with a very unique premise: a police detective
        living in the present comes across a walkie-talkie that allows him to contact
        a police detective from the past. The two of them collaborate to solve cold cases,
        and fight against corruption in their police department.</p>

        <p>I loved the way the story would jump between the past and present, gradually revealing more about each character and their past.
        While it was very exciting to watch the cases unfold, this show is more than just a crime thriller. It is a story about people
        doing their best to fight for justice in a corrupt system. The story does a great job addressing
        the impact of violent crime and a corrupt police system on the families of victims and on society as a whole.</p>

    <div class="its-ok-to-not-be-ok">
        <h3 id="title-its-ok-to-not-be-ok">3. It's Okay To Not Be Okay</h3>

        <img src="./images/its-okay-to-not-be-okay.jpg" />

        <p><em>It's Okay To Not Be Okay</em> tells the story of Moon Gang-tae, a caregiver at a mental institution,
        who cares for his autistic older brother Moon Sang-tae. They meet Ko Moon-young, a famous children's
        storybook author who is rumored to have antisocial personality disorder.</p>

        <p> I was amazed by the performances in
        this show. Seo Yea-ji, who played Ko Moon-young, had such a presence on screen that I was spellbound. But I was
        most impressed by Oh Jung-se, who played Moon Sang-tae, Gang-tae's autistic older brother. His performance felt
        so authentic, and I quickly grew to love his character.</p>

        <p>Both the story and the characters in this show were so captivating.
        I appreciate the fact that this show explores mental health
        issues, and encourages us to accept those who are different from us.</p>

    <div class="my-mister">
        <h3 id="title-my-mister">2. My Mister</h3>

        <img src="./images/my-mister.jpeg" />

        <p><em>My Mister</em> tells the story of an impoverished young woman who is struggling with
        debt as she cares for her deaf, sick grandmother. She forms a close friendship with her
        supervisor, who is also suffering because of the constant scrutiny and manipulation he faces at work,
        and his dysfunctional family.</p>

        <p>This show is hard to watch at times because of how much the
        characters suffer, but I found it beautiful and deeply moving. Many of the characters, even though they
        are living miserable lives, are such great people. I felt so inspired by their resilience and kindness and how they
        could support each other during times of need. There are many beautiful moments in the show and pieces of wisdom
        that I still think about now.</p>

    <div class="reply-1988">
        <h3 id="title-reply-1988">1. Reply 1988</h3>

        <img src="./images/reply-1988.jpg" />

        <p><em>Reply 1988</em> is not only my favourite KDrama, but is by far the best TV
            show I've ever watched. The story follows five friends and their families
        who live in the neighborhood of Ssangmun-dong, in Seoul. </p>

        <p>As you watch the show you
        get immersed in the daily lives of these characters, and witness their day to day struggles
        and moments of joy. Every character in this show has so much depth that by the end you
        feel like they are your close friend. I was so moved by the sense of community among
        the five familes and how they are all bound together through bonds of familial love and
        lifelong friendship.</p> 

        <p></p>I don't think I can do justice to this show by writing about it, but 
        there are few things I've watched that have had this kind of impact on me.</p>
